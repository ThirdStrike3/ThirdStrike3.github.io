            Holy fuck, Ernie Ladd is huge. He completely dwarfs Sammartino, who already looks big compared to the ref. It's astounding. He's surprisingly nimble in-ring too, obviously not as quick as some wrestlers but he's a very competant big man especially at selling, and his leg drop looks fucking vicious. I also love the crunch sound the ring makes whenever there's a bump. Ernie's missed top rope splash finish of the match is a bit anticlimactic though. This is a very good match.
