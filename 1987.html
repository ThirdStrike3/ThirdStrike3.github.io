        <p>
            Despite being mythologised on a bed of lies I still have a lot of respect and a bit of love for the most famous WrestleMania match ever. Told a simple story in the most captivating way. I wish Andre was the champ going into this, would have made it so much more impactful. No matter how much you dislike Hogan, you can't help but cheer for him here.
