            So fucking violent. Less a wrestling match and more two men beating the absolute piss out of each other. Those screams into the mic are legitimately terrifying. The image of Magnum piercing Blanchard's forehead with the broken chair leg is one of the most viscerally brilliant things I've ever seen.
