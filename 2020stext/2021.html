            Awful. Botches galore. Stupid countout finish which doesn't even make a difference when the match gets restarted anyway. Of course Nia fucking sucks but even Charlotte and Shayna are in poor form here.

            Basically, the story of this match is that neither woman has much chemistry with the other in the ring, and after numerous botched moves and failed spots, they stop pretending to care and actually start attacking each other with stiff shots, no-selling and sandbagging. I have this match rated quite low but it's actually a pretty interesting watch, just cause it's kind of exciting to see a full on shoot happening in the ring like it's the 1970s again. God that fucking drop on Charlotte's head by Nia looked awful, reminds me of how green Goldberg was when he first started. My favourite part is the last four or so minutes where every single move looks terrible.
