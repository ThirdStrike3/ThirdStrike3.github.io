            So fucking violent. Less a wrestling match and more two men beating the absolute piss out of each other. Those screams into the mic are legitimately terrifying. The image of Magnum piercing Blanchard's forehead with the broken chair leg is one of the most viscerally brilliant things I've ever seen.

            Despite being mythologised on a bed of lies I still have a lot of respect and a bit of love for the most famous WrestleMania match ever. Told a simple story in the most captivating way. I wish Andre was the champ going into this, would have made it so much more impactful. No matter how much you dislike Hogan, you can't help but cheer for him here.
