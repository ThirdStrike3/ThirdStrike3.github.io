            Angle and Benoit had consistently incredible matches any time they were paired together, on PPV or regular TV, and this might be their best ever. Great technical wrestling, Tazz on commentary really shines here, I like how he defends the legality of Kurt's rear chin lock and explains each move's effectiveness. You'd never get that on WWE recently. The match has a great pace where everyone in the building gets more invested over time. Angle is so fucking fast in the ring, love when he pops up and gives Benoit a belly-to-belly off the top rope. The German suplexes are insane, especially the one where Angle does a full moonsault as a sell. Love this match. Was considering a 4.75 but the ending five minutes are so good I have to give full marks.

            Exhibit A of why SmackDown was better than Raw in the 2000s - they experimented with match types and had PPV quality matches on free TV, with this one perhaps being the most impressive of all. I love how they concluded a series of three at a TV showing too, it gives this match a huge weight that no other TV matches from that period had. Brock starts off really hot and Angle returns. Brock fakes a time-out and attacks Angle, and then stalls for time outside the ring like a great heel should. He batters Angle with a chair and loses a fall, then hilariously asks the commentary team for a bottle of water, which I assume wasn't rehearsed. Tazz and Cole spend way too long explaining why Lesnar used the chair to weaken Angle, it's not really that hard to figure out. Brock gets a pinfall and a submission and he's now in the lead by one fall. Some more hard-hitting offense, including an F5 on the outside, and Angle gets counted out.

            Angle gets it back to 3-2 with an Angle Slam to Lesnar. Cole says they've been given permission by the network to go to overtime in case of a draw - great suspense-building move. Kurt almost hits the ref, but Brock flips him inside out with a great clothesline. Brock loses his cool and hits Angle with the title, which Angle sells amazingly, and Brock gets another fall just after the halfway mark. Kurt tries a unique double axe handle move to the outside and then does an INCREDIBLE missile dropkick to Brock in the ring. I can't believe he had the strength to do it after working for so long, and with such perfect form. Almost trying to one-up him, Lesnar delivers a perfect belly-to-belly suplex and sends Kurt flying. Brock gets a fall during a break and is now leading 5 to 2. Angle gets another fall and fires himself up in a great sequence. He gets Lesnar to tap with just under 5 minutes left. Both men use everything in their arsenal - Angle lets loose a barrage of German suplexes, Brock cheats and hits him with a low blow, but Angle comes out of nowhere and gets a grapevined ankle lock locked in. Lesnar manages to last it out and wins 5 to 4.

            This would be a standout match on a PPV, but for free TV this is absolutely insane. While there are places where I think more could've been done, this match is so smartly paced and executed that I have to give it a near-perfect score.

            First off, fucking LOL. Only Vince could think of an idea as fucked up as this, at least it's not as bad as his attempted proposal of an incest storyline. Vince is awesome at working heel here, and I love how he's like the "final boss" for Steph here, after her run-ins with A-Train and Brock. Steph looks amazing in her ring gear, she was probably hotter than Sable at this point. Unfortunately, this match is far too long for its own good and some of the spots are just uncomfortable to watch, in a bad way. Steph is an absolutely amazing seller though, and the crowd goes wild for every bit of offense she gets. Steph is apparently allowed to win by pinfall which is odd due to the rules of "I Quit" matches, but it does make sense considering there's no realistic way she'd be able to overpower her dad in a submission hold. Vince does a great bottom rope foot spot on the 2nd pinfall attempt. And of course, we get the absolutely ridiculous spot where Vince chokes Steph out with a lead pipe to end the match. Bad match but worth a watch.

        <p>If you're really into the "sports entertainment" side of WWE and don't mind a pretty risqu√© angle, there's a decent chance you'll get some enjoyment out of this.</p>
