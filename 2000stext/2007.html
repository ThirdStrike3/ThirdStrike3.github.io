        <h3>WWE Heavyweight Title Fatal Four Way Match</h3>
        <h3>29/4/2007</h3>

            One of my favourite four way matches. Orton's clotheslines look awesome in this match. Cena's clotheslines look crap in comparison. Contrived bowling pin spot on the outside by Michaels but it does look impressive. Rated RKO eventually team up to beat on Michaels, and get him in a double Boston crab. Not a huge fan of stuff like this because it's obvious it won't work as there can't be joint holders of one belt. Cena comes in to break it up, and the crowd absolutely hates him. Edge hits Michaels with a chair on the outside and attempts to do the same for Cena in the ring, but Cena gets him in the STF. There's a rope break afterwards which again doesn't make much sense as it's a No DQ match so it doesn't matter if Cena gets a 5-count, but it's forgivable. Michaels counters Cena's STF into a really good small package nearfall but only gets a 2. The match really kicks up a pace or five at this point, and it feels like all four men are involved at once, rather than just two brawling at a time like before. Counters on top of counters on top of counters. And of course we have one of the best accidental pins in WWE history to cap it off, with Shawn superkicking Cena who gets a lifeless 3 count on Randy. If the whole match was like the last three minutes it would be an easy 5 but it starts out a little too slow to reach that mantle.

            Another representation of how lazy the WWE was with its women's division in the late 2000s. There wasn't even a women's title match on the card, because they couldn't be fucked booking any feuds for them. All you get is a #1 contendership battle royal with basically every woman on the roster, and the bookers didn't even trust the women involved to be able to throw the others over the top rope so the rule is you just have to throw someone out of the ring to eliminate them. Also, Lawler is INSUFFERABLE here, and I'm watching the YouTube version of the match so I guarantee the uncensored cut is unwatchable. Kelly Kelly's elimination is terrible. At least they picked the obvious correct winner in Beth Phoenix.

        <h2>TNA Bound For Glory 2007</h2>
        <h3>TNA Women's Knockout Title Gauntlet Match</h3>
        <h3>14/10/2007</h3>

        <p>
            This is a Gauntlet Match, which is just a Royal Rumble match but with the added unnecessary stipulation that the final two competitors have a singles match rather than attempting to throw each other over the top rope. This is not to be confused with the WWE's Gauntlet match type, which involves pinfalls and submissions throughout and the last person in the ring wins. Got it?

            Ms. Brooks and her enormous boobs are out first. Jackie Moore is 2nd and struts to the ring. The announcers tell us it's going to be 60-second intervals, which is reminiscent of the 1995 Rumble, and is also far too short. They go way overkill with it, with a timer showing at 30 seconds and then the final 10-second countdown. Jackie's German suplex looks fucking nasty, she just drops Brooks on her head. Shelly Martinez 3rd who delivers sloppy looking back strikes and a weird snap swinging neckbreaker variation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Action in the ring stops as Awesome Kong makes her Godzilla theme entrance, which is really cool. Takes a while though, and she's only just in the ring when the next countdown begins. Camera pans to ODB's entrance and misses Martinez being eliminated, but just catches Jackie eliminating Brooks. Kong's Implant Buster to Jackie looks good, and after she eliminates her the commentators erroneously claim she has eliminated three women. Angel Williams comes in next and teams with ODB to attack Kong, who no sells most of the offense and delivers a double suplex. Christy Hemme comes in next and gets put in a brutal looking rack by Kong.

            Gail Kim comes in and gives a good missile dropkick to Awesome Kong. She puts a triangle lock on her head, and with the help of ODB and Williams, eliminates her. Hilariously Kong's outfit flies up on elimination and reveals her breasts to the camera. I really like how much they put her over though, and how dominant she was in her section of the match. Talia Madison comes in next and Angel Williams does a Flair bump to the outside and a Stunner to Madison on the top rope. She can't stop ODB and Gail Kim teaming up, however, and gets eliminated.
        </p>

            Final entrant is Roxxi Laveaux. Talia Madison botches an Irish whip and Kim has to correct her. Gail eliminates Madison and Roxxi eliminates ODB, so we have Gail vs. Roxxi in a singles match. Great looking Samoan drop from Roxxi and a great looking octopus submission from Gail. The ref audibly tells Gail that there's only one minute left. Missed missile dropkick, a few tense nearfalls and an Emerald Flowsion later and Gail gets the 3 and wins.
        </p>
        <p>
            I actually think this match is very solid and is booked super well for the short time it's on. Kong looks insanely strong, Roxxi and Gail are built up to be fierce competitors with the slight edge to Gail, and there are not that many botches to ruin it. If the singles match at the end was a bit longer I might even call this match great.
