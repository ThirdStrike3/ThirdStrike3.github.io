        <h3>2/4/2006</h3>

            Compared to the previous year's ladder match, a bit of a disappointment, but still really good. RVD is really over here and the crowd is fully behind him. Shelton does an epic ladder run Swanton to the outside early on, fuck he was so good at ladder matches. 57-year-old Flair takes a huge suplex off the ladder and the ref throws up a worked X sign, interesting to see in 2006 as they only really started doing this spot recently. RVD rolls thunder onto a ladder which looks very nasty. Crowd is not behind Lashley at all when he starts climbing, but Shelton does another wicked jump over the ladder to powerbomb him along with Finlay and Matt Hardy. Finlay takes everyone out with a ladder, and then for some reason decides to knock the other ladder over instead of attempt to climb it. Flair comes back and takes another bump off the ladder, then does nothing for the rest of the match. Lashley again tries to climb but takes a dropkicked chair to the back from RVD. Some more attempts and RVD hits a frogsplash off the ladder to Finlay. RVD climbs but Shelton does a perfect jump from the ropes onto the ladder and beats on him. Looked incredible. Hardy comes up on a separate ladder and Benjamin moves between both, until RVD boots them both off and wins. Benjamin was easily the MVP of this match, RVD also did great and Flair's spot was just fucking weird.
