            Big Show, gone from headlining Wrestlemania the previous year to being in and losing the hardcore match on this one. That's gotta sting. He works much better in this type of matchup though. Kane and Raven fight before Show even does his entrance and the bell rings for some reason. They leave the ring almost immediately and there's a lot of walking in the crowd, while the cameramen have to push their way through. Very chaotic feeling which I enjoy. Show attempts to lock a door to go one-on-one with Raven, but Kane gets it open really easily, which I think is attempting to make him look strong but doesn't really because the lock is so flimsy. A lot of throwing, through a window, a door and a wall. Raven crashes his golf cart and almost cuts power to the arena, but they decently improvise with the other cart. You can hear people chanting "fuck him up". JR and Heyman plug Snapple in a creative way, then the brawling goes back into the arena and Kane eventually gets the win. For a jokey hardcore match, it's done very well, but obviously doesn't compare to something like Rock vs. Mankind in the empty arena.

            Matches like this are an underrated part of the reason that X-Seven is almost unanimously regarded as the best WWE pay-per-view of all time. In a lesser show this would be given almost no thought, a throwaway match between the matches people actually care about. However, this was when the federation actually knew how to structure matches and not just go for cheap nostalgia pops like they do nowadays.

            First off, Brain and Okerlund commentating. Perfect decision, why not have the era of the commentators reflect the era of the performers? It also helps that they're maybe the two greatest speakers in the WWF, but I digress. Unlike most battle royals, we get a series of entrances for all the players which are given ample amounts of time. This is what you want in a match where almost no-one can actually work properly. It also gives fans the time to remember these guys and for their themes to play, so it doesn't feel like they're treated as jokes even if they are "gimmicks". It's the level of respect that they deserve. Really enjoyed this section and Heenan and Okerlund are on fire with quotables, you can tell they're enjoying themselves being back in the booth. Hillbilly Jim's entrance is the best, that stupid lean back chin pose he does is fucking hilarious.

            And thankfully, they recognised that the actual match needed to be over quickly so eliminations are thick and fast. It comes down to Iron Sheik, Hillbilly Jim and Sgt. Slaughter at the end. I assume Slaughter was meant to win as it would make the most sense for a face former champion to come out on top, but reportedly Sheik's knees were so fucked he couldn't take an over-the-rope bump so he ends up winning the whole thing. Slaughter gives the Cobra Clutch to Sheik after the match to get his heat back and his theme plays.

            I really like this segment. My high rating for it is because of the polish and craft that the WWF put into it to ensure it was the best it could be, not for the quality of the battle royal match itself. Awesome stuff.

            Absolutely batshit tag match where everything moves at 100 miles per hour and by the end no one knows who's legal and who's not. It's fucking amazing throughout but when Benoit locks in the crossface on Austin, and Jericho does that perfect lionsault to knock Triple H down, it becomes masterful. Austin, Benoit and Jericho all do fucking amazing, but Triple H is clearly the MVP of this match for tearing his fucking quads and still continuing, even taking a Walls of Jericho. Everything that you could want in an early 2000s Raw main event is here. The wrestling. The excitement of the crowd. The pure chaos, everywhere you look. Five five five five five.

        <p>Probably the best Raw main event of all time, so recommended to everyone.</p>

        <h2>WWF Raw #443</h2>
        <h3>WWF World Women's Title Match</h3>
        <h3>19/11/2001</h3>

        <p>
            The storyline into this match is that Lita believes that Matt Hardy might be cheating on her with Trish, after seeing them both leave a locker room one after another. Quite ironic in hindsight given what would actually happen in real life between Lita and Matt later on, but I digress. Jerry Lawler is also back from his real-life firing and on the commentary booth, and this is where his puppies schtick started getting really grating. However, the main problem with this match is that neither woman has enough experience in-ring, and very little chemistry with each other which is not their fault given the fed was more interested in booking bra and panties matches between them at this point rather than actually teaching them to, you know, wrestle. Not a good match and has a few noticeably bad botches including a horrible irish whip reversal sequence at the start. Also, why isn't Matt carrying Lita back to the ring considered a DQ? Who knows, who cares. Both women would go on to have much better matches in the future, with each other no less.
