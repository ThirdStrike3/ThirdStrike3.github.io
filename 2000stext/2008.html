            So nice to have another Rumble with MSG hard cam entrances. It's a shame we'll never get one like it again now that the Garden's been renovated and that entranceway has been changed. There's a 6-man commentary team here of JR, King, Michael Cole, Tazz, Joey Styles and Coach here which actually ends up working out much better than expected, certainly leagues more refined and less sloppy than the commentary booths of the 2010s.

            Undertaker out first, and his entrance is especially cool with the purple neon lights and the close-up camerawork. HBK is out next, making the first two participants a mirror of the last two participants in the previous year's Rumble. Absolutely amazing, I'm always happy to see any match with these two involved (unless it's in Saudi Arabia). #3 Santino Marella eats Sweet Chin Music and is thrown out by Taker, who narrowly avoids getting eliminated by Shawn right after. I really like how both men team up throughout the match to eliminate guys, just so they can try to have a singles match against each other. Taker tries to go old school but Shawn reverses into an arm drag. Wrong direction, Shawn!

            #4 is Khali who has to duck under the entranceway because he's so tall. Crowd is having none of it and immediately chant "You can't wrestle" at him. Taker eliminates Khali to a huge pop. Telling how Khali was had Diesel "insane force-to-be-reckoned with" booking in the previous year's Rumble and now is almost on the same level as fucking Santino. Hardcore Holly is next and literally cannot stop himself from being stiff, as within 15 seconds he's stomped on Shawn's nose and busted it open. His Undertaker big boot sell is good though. John Morrison comes in at number 6. Hometown hero Tommy Dreamer gets a huge pop and e-c-dub chants on his entrance. Unfortunately he doesn't last long, as #8 Batista throws him out for interrupting a staredown spot with Taker. Batista celebrates by giving a very mid spear to Morrison. Mr. McMahon's illegitimate son Hornswoggle is in next and hides under the ring just like Lawler in '96, which commentary makes reference to.

            Rivals Chuck Palumbo and Jamie "Mini-Benoit" Noble in next, who get no pop and a little pop respectively. Noble is out super quick and sells a rib injury outside the ring. Incredibly over CM Punk is #12 and takes a stiff-looking but probably safe clothesline from Taker. I think this was when they were having real life issues with each other and it's sort of apparent in-ring. Punk eliminates Palumbo. Cody Rhodes in next and Undertaker no-sells all his offense besides a dropkick. Shawn is still bumping like crazy even at about the 20-minute mark, I know it's said often but damn he's such a great wrestler and could go for ages, even at this stage of his career. Umaga is next in and delivers some awesome looking clotheslines before Samoan spiking Holly over the top rope. The beads fall off his necklace while Batista batters him in the corner which the refs hilariously have to pick up.

            Halfway through the Rumble now and our 15th entrant is Snitsky, who's usually a pretty crappy wrestler but does OK in this match. Miz comes in next and Styles makes a comment about how he despises CM Punk. Nowadays it's more the opposite way around. Shelton Benjamin is #17 and shows off his amazing talent and athleticism... for about 20 seconds, before taking a superkick from Shawn Michaels and being eliminated. Couldn't they have let this guy go for one Rumble without looking like a complete jobber?
        </p>

            Jimmy Snuka is #18, raising the number of people who have actually murdered their girlfriend and used their connection to Vince McMahon to get away with it in the match by 1. Everyone sells for Snuka's senile offense. Funny moment as Roddy Piper comes in next and we get a staredown followed by some silly blow-trading. Punk is having the time of his life watching it and him and Morrison have a brief chat before Morrison boots him in the face. Kane comes in next and eliminates both of them (Snuka and Piper, not Morrison and Punk) and gives Miz an amazing chokeslam. Taker teases an Undertaker vs. Kane feud revival but thankfully goes for Shawn instead.

            #21 Carlito comes in and spits an apple right into Cody Rhodes' face. #22 is Mick Foley who gets a huge pop and Foley chants. This is his last match in WWE besides the 2012 Rumble and it's apparent why, as he can only really do basic punches and moves very awkwardly in the ring. JR is putting over Umaga heavy throughout this match. KENNEDDAYY is out next and the ring is starting to get really full. Big Bastard V and his cleavage are out next but nobody cares, as a Snitsky > Undertaker > HBK elimination train occurs, with Shawn being eliminated by Mr. Kennedy. Great spot and genuinely unexpected. What's not so great is Taker doing a shitty leg drop to Snitsky on the announce table for no reason. That didn't need to happen.</p>

            Mark Henry is number #25. Hornswoggle does his comedy bit and eliminates future WWE champion Miz before crawling back under the ring. #26 is the CURRENT ECW champion Chavo Guerrero. I absolutely hate this. May I remind you that at the time, WWE was pretending to try and push ECW as a third brand on equal footing to Raw or SmackDown, and I'm pretty sure it was even in kayfabe rules that you could challenge for the ECW championship if you won the Rumble. So why is the ECW champion even in the fucking match? They obviously wouldn't put the WWE or World champ in there, so all it does is devalue the championship and by extension the brand. Reason #1094 that WWECW sucked.

            John Morrison takes an excellent elimination from Kane. Finlay supposedly jumps the gun and comes in before his entrance number to save Hornswoggle when the latter is stuck between the big black guy double combo of Viscera and Mark Henry. JR then notifies us Finlay has been disqualified for using the shillelagh. Again, stupid fucking decision as Rumbles are NO DQ by default and loads of people have used weapons in the past. You could say that maybe he got disqualified for coming in too early but Al Snow did that in 2001 and didn't get disqualified. Rule of thumb for Rumbles - disqualification spots are fucking dumb. And Hornswoggle never gets DQed either so it makes even less sense. Either way, both men exit the match and are not heard from again.

            #28 is Elijah Burke who gets essentially no reaction. CM Punk gets eliminated by Chavo Guerrero over ECW-related business. Huge pop for Triple H coming in at #29 and his interaction with Foley in-ring, with commentary noting the Royal Rumble 2000 street fight also at MSG. Rhodes, Big Daddy V, Foley and Burke all fall victim to The Game and V looks goofy waddling out. And then of course, we get the entirely unexpected return of John Cena at number 30. Everyone in the stadium is on their feet. Even MSG, one of the smarkiest venues the WWE performs in, who is filled with Cena haters, even they recognised how fucking awesome this moment was. This and Edge's return in 2020 are easily the two best in Rumble history. Then of course he gets in the ring and people remembered why they hated him and a booing contingent forms, but oh well.

            The pool whittles down and Supercena, Batista and Triple H are the last 3 remaining. Each of them do their taunts in a pretty cool sequence then have an average exchange of moves and finishers until Batista is gone. Both of them do the WrestleMania sign point spot, which is super overplayed now but was actually the first time that spot had ever been done. H and Cena have a decent fight and the crowd shows which side they're on by booing the fuck out of Cena and cheering Triple H. Cena Adjusts Hunter's Attitude over the top rope and wins.

            This definitely isn't a workrate-based match, which it doesn't have to be of course - it's a Rumble. There's a good mix of comedy moments, decent spots and a nice flow of eliminations here, and of course we get one all-time great moment in the number 30 entrant. While there's nothing this Rumble does that's particularly incredible, it's a very solid one and I would have definitely been satisfied had I paid for it in 2008.
