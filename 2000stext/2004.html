            I believe this is the only Royal Rumble match to ever take place on a regular TV show in WWE. Pretty cool, shows how innovative SmackDown was during this period. Angle and Rhyno start. Charlie Haas comes in and immediately goes for Angle. Nice dropkick. Shelton Benjamin in next and much of the same. APA Bradshaw follows and is really stiff as usual. Ernest Miller enters, does his comedy shit and is eliminated all during the commercial break, which they then have to show a replay of after Tajiri's entrance. Billy Gunn and Big Show follow. On the edited version, Cole says "He was the last man.... in that rumble matchup." Hmmm. He looks good here, as he did in the PPV, and eliminates Tajiri and Bradshaw. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Cena comes in and after the commercial break, we are told he eliminated Nunzio. Wait, when did he get in the match? And how did they fit two entrances in one break since we can also see A-Train is in the ring? Eddie Guerrero comes in next after supposedly being too injured to compete, and eliminates A-Train. Big Kish is #14 and does stinkfaces to Show, Benjamin and Billy Gunn. Very lame final entrant in Hardcore Holly, couldn't Eddie have been last? Everyone teams up to eliminate Show, which is actually the only time it's ever taken multiple people to eliminate him despite what every commentator says when he enters a PPV Rumble. In the far corner, Gunn and Angle set up for a double stinkface spot, which never happens because the cameras cut to replays of eliminations instead. Team Angle and Holly get eliminated, and Holly gets his Hogan on as he cries over being eliminated. Eddie eliminates Ass Man and hangs on in a genuinely precarious spot, very well done. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Both Eddie and Angle eliminate Rikishi and suddenly we have a singles match. A really, really good singles match. Both men are just amazing, especially Angle who's been working for half an hour at this point, and put on a brilliant, nail-biting performance, with Eddie coming out on top. Very good match overall, especially for regular TV, but it's carried by the last segment.

            "This is going to be, no doubt, a high impact, smash mouth matchup." Oh how wrong you were, JR. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't know the story behind this match, it was essentially doomed from the get-go as it was known both men were leaving the WWE soon after; Brock to go to the NFL, and Goldberg was just not interested in renewing his contract. As such, neither men was willing to take any serious bumps in the match for fear of an injury that could set them back. So what did we get? The answer is: nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
            No, seriously. Nothing happens in this match. The guys look at each other, and wait. Guest referee Steve Austin just stands around, occasionally reminding the two men to, you know, actually fight some time. The crowd is already fucking annoyed because they can tell what's going to happen - nothing. The commentary team have to kill time because there is literally nothing going on in the ring. JR brings up the fact Brock is going to the NFL, which cannot be scripted because it just makes WWE look bad. King says he likes Stone Cold's officiating because he's just "standing back and letting these two bulls go at it". May I remind you again that no offensive move has been made at this point. Crowd chants for Austin because he's the only over person in the ring.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oh my god, an offensive move final- no wait, it's just a lock up. Crowd chants "boring". I would have liked it if Lawler tried to do the Royal Rumble 2000 trick again and claim they were chanting "Goldberg". Another lock up. We are now 5 minutes into the match and neither man has done one offensive move. The commentators are getting very impatient. Side headlock followed by a ludicrously weak shove. More taunting. Both men go to the ropes and finally, they both take a bump. A shit looking bump, but a bump nonetheless. Crowd chants "bullshit".
        </p>
        <p>
            Goldberg does the first good move of the match and converts a military press into a mid-air spear. Looked excellent, it's just a shame we've had to wait more than half the match length for it. Brawling on the outside and Lesnar gives some suplexes. I don't usually comment on matches in this much play-by-play detail but there's just nothing else to work with. The crowd turn their head to the right and start chanting for... Hogan? No, he's not doing a run-in. The crowd are so bored with the match, they're cheering two fans wearing Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage costumes who are pretending to cut promos on each other. One of the great crowd-hijacking moments in wrestling. Who can blame them? More chinlocks and weak offense. Another Hogan chant. Goldberg spears Lesnar. Two count. Lesnar F5s Goldberg. Two count. Please end soon. Another spear, and Goldberg taunts only to receive a shower of boos. A jackhammer and Goldberg wins.
        </p>

            Stone Cold does his best to save the segment post-match by giving both men Stunners. He has literally done nothing besides count pins in the match so they must have thrown him in just for this, to hopefully get some cheers. It works. Stone Cold is the man. Horrendous match, and the interesting things that did happen came from everywhere BUT the ring.

            I love how often Lawler puts over that Orton could be a "model" before and throughout this match. Really makes the moments when he gets disfigured all the more affecting. Fit Foley enters with what looks like a 2x4 in barbed wire, but is actually a baseball bat. Foley goes crazy from the get-go with some really wild strikes that down a cameraman within the first 30 seconds. Really chaotic and exciting. Orton is kicked to the outside then gets a swinging neckbreaker and Cactus goes up high, but Orton walks up the ramp to avoid it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nasty looking suplex and head smash on the ramp but Foley keeps kicking out. They make it back to the ring and Orton sells a Foley clothesline quite well. Cactus considers taking out Socko, but puts it to the audience to decide between it or the Barbie bat. Bat wins and Foley clotheslines Orton with it, who blades and is pouring blood almost immediately. BRUTAL moment as Orton gets the barbed wire bat kicked into his junk, which made me wince. Crowd pop insanely for Foley attempting to pour gasoline and light Barbie on fire but Bischoff shuts it down, which really pisses the crowd off. Foley gets them back on the match's side by pulling out a wooden board covered in barbed wire.
        </p>
        <p>
            As usual when Foley pulls something out from under the ring, Orton reverses and bodyslams him onto the wire. Amazing double Irish whip reversal from the corner and Foley goes into the board three more times. We then come to the most famous spot of the match - rightfully so - when Orton takes out the thumbtacks and in a genuinely unexpected move, Foley reverses an RKO and Orton takes a disgusting bare-skin thumbtack bump on his back. Good God, this moment. Orton looks like he's legitimately paralysed and Lawler's reaction to seeing the thumbtacks embedded in Orton's back is incredible. The tacks are everywhere but Orton still manages to kick out of a pinfall at 2. Looked super strong. Foley's arm is covered in blood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Orton flees to the back but Foley catches up and pulls him into the arena. He takes an insane bump off the stage onto some wooden boards and wiring, which must have been agony on his back. The EMTs come out for Orton and referees escort Foley to the back, and the match ends. Just kidding, of course, as Foley hits both referees and does an insane elbow drop off the stage onto Orton, who must have felt like he was on fire at this point. Mick pins Randy, one, two - KICKOUT! If Randy looked strong before he looks goddamn unstoppable now. Both men are back on the ramp and a small e-c-dub chant starts, along with an idiot fan who holds his sign up the wrong way. DDT to Orton, but another 2. Randy gets some hard looking offense in with Barbie but Cactus gets the Mandible Claw in - bit of a goofy choice after the brutality of the last 20 minutes. Foley's face is covered in blood. Randy reverses into an RKO outta nowhere, and gets a nearfall where the ref gets a tack embedded in his hand. RKO onto Barbie and finally Randy wins, which was weirdly anticlimactic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hard to say whether this or the Royal Rumble 2000 Street Fight is better. Both put over Foley's opponent immensely, and both had some of the most famous spots in WWE history. I will say that this match has a slightly better pace in my opinion, with less dead time near the start, but the ending is obviously not nearly as good as the Rumble fight. Regardless of that, this is still an all-time classic bout, maybe the best Backlash match ever, and a clear 5 if you're into this style of wrestling.
