            Probably the best hoss fight in the WWE due to the talent of both men (yes, Test was talented) and its relatively short length. Punches, kicks, slams, brutal offense throughout. Test's kicks and clotheslines look great. EPIC big boot and near fall. Good match, unfortunately with a dead crowd.

            Fucking barnburner to start off SummerSlam. Two of the fastest guys in the company with non-stop offense for just under 10 minutes. I love Kurt's insane wheelbarrow German suplex to Mysterio. There's so many complex counters here and it all happens so quick, these guys had insane ring chemistry. The ref physically prevents Rey from doing a suicide dive (which shouldn't happen in a match) but Rey ignores him and does it anyway, covering insane distance and height. "Holy shit" chants abound. Rey puts in some serious offense and almost gets a 3-count, but Kurt counters a hurricanrana into an ankle lock and Rey has to tap. Wonderful, furiously fast match.

        <h2>WWE SummerSlam 2002</h2>
        <h3>Unsanctioned Match</h3>
        <h3>25/8/2002</h3>

        <p>
            First PPV match between these two, who I always thought had phenomenal chemistry as opponents, maybe more so than as friends. Match starts hot and Shawn looks very athletic as always, even skinning the cat to show off. HHH targets Shawn's fucked back, and Hebner gets pretty annoying with how often he gets in his way and yells at Triple H to stop. I get in storyline he's supposedly concerned for Shawn's safety, but it's literally an unsanctioned match. The match has had a slow pace as with many Triple H matches but it's super engaging because it gives both men time to really sell their injuries, especially Shawn and his back. Hunter forgets where his sledgehammer is and has to go hunting (no pun intended) for it. Hebner and Triple H start pushing each other around, which is actually a pretty cool spot, giving Shawn some time to regenerate. He tries to fly high but HHH sends Hebner into the ropes to knock him down. Nasty looking back drop into the chair in the middle of the ring, and a sidewalk slam into it again for good measure. The crowd are feeding off of literally every movement the men make at this point, it's really good. Shawn hits a perfect Sweet Chin Music at the perfect time, HHH blades really deep as expected and his chest is covered in blood almost immediately.

            Shawn kips up and starts jumping around the ring. Cool spot as always but it's like he's forgotten about the beating his back just took, almost like the match resets at this point. HHH takes an insanely fake jumping bump to the outside with almost no initial momentum. Shawn steals one of the announcer's shoes and hits Triple H with it, and Lawler says "a heel for a heel", bit of a kayfabe-breaking line which I enjoyed. More offense now involving a ladder. Shawn does a superplex but turns to avoid landing on his back, really smart spot but since he's ignored selling his back for so long it just seems a bit pointless. Shawn does a weird Rey Mysterio kind of thing where he tries to whizz around Triple H, but seems to fail and goes for a roll-up that we can see he physically pushes himself off of. Looked terrible. Shawn gets a table out to the delight of the audience. Standard looking top-rope jump onto the table and elbow drop from the ladder, and Michaels gets the pin after a fake-out tune-up. Triple H gets his heat back with a great post-match beatdown. JR is amazing on commentary selling pure fucking hatred for "that son of a bitch." Great performance overall but the first half is better than the 2nd, which just kind of comes out of nowhere and feels like a different match.
