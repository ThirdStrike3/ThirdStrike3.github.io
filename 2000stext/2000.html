            Rikishi looks strong here, this was when they were considering him for WWF champion. He shouldn't have gotten it but he was pretty imposing in the ring at this point so I understand why they tried. Steph is on commentary and they keep cutting to a shot of her attempting to look distressed. Rikishi is AMAZING at selling clotheslines, he flips like a cruiserweight. Crowd is really into it and there's a huge pop when Rikishi kicks out of a chair shot. Great main event.

            Angle delivers a good promo to begin the match. He references a "mystery opponent". The crowd here clearly didn't get the memo as they keep chanting "We want Tazz" over and over. His badass theme hits and Tazz makes his WWE debut, on a PPV no less. Champ Kurt does a moonsault sell of Tazz's German suplex, but due to Tazz's size it's a bit obvious Kurt's jump is doing most of the work. Tazz uses the Tazzmission to choke Kurt out and gets the win. Great way to set up Tazz as a beast (even if they fucking butchered his push) and gives Kurt an out for rematches with the dubious legality of the move.

        <h3>23/1/2000</h3>

        <p>
            The whole build-up to this match is very good. I love how Triple H really sold the Cactus Jack transformation, it makes him seem like such a threat. The ramp is set up to look like an alleyway, making this feel like an actual "street fight". Satisfying sound as Jack hits Triple H's head into the ring bell. Lots of punching and they eventually brawl out into the crowd, then into the alleyway ramp. Hunter takes a good-looking suplex onto some wooden pallets. The crowd begins to chant "Boring" which King claims is them chanting "Foley". The match has been a little slow but I'm not sure why the crowd turned on it so quickly. Cactus attempts to knee HHH's head into the steel steps, where it looks like he rolls away at the last second but Cactus doesn't sell any pain so JR covers for them. For some reason the ref physically gets in Foley's way (which should not happen in a street fight, imo) when he tries to use the barbed wire 2x4, so HHH steals it and gives some hard shots to Jack's body. Great fake-out as the ref hides the 2x4, so Cactus demands it back and hits the Spanish announcer in the process. He gives TWO shots to Triple H's head, and his bladejob looks monstrous. Everything from this point on is perfect. Jack takes a really nasty-looking back body drop on the announce table where it doesn't break, and the crowd are actually chanting "Foley" now. Hunter hip-blocks Cactus into the steel steps and it looks like he really fucks up his knee. He does it again and it looks even more painful than the previous one. Triple H works Foley's knee while masterfully selling his own injuries, including a deep gash on his own leg. Cactus gets handcuffed and starts playing really dirty, with low blows and biting, like a caged animal. Triple H gives some vile chair shots and actually breaks a steel chair on Cactus's back. They frame the alleyway really well and Rock comes flying out of nowhere with a fast but safe chair shot to Triple H. Absolutely disgusting piledriver to HHH on the Spanish announce table, probably the most dangerous move of the match. Foley gets thumbtacks out. Huge pop. Triple H back body drops him onto the tacks and Pedigrees him. 1... 2... FOLEY KICKS OUT!!!!!!!!!! Crowd go fucking apeshit. First time I saw this I legitimately popped out of my seat it was that unexpected. Triple H delivers another Pedigree directly on the thumbtacks and the ref has to slam his hand into them to count to three. Triple H sold perfectly and Foley worked the crowd expertly. One of the most physical. intense, scary, and above all BRUTAL matches ever in the WWF. Easy, easy five here.

        <h3>Royal Rumble Match</h3>
        <h3>23/1/2000</h3>

        <p>
            Perhaps because of the clusterfuck of the 1999 Rumble match, we get a lot more reserved and normal match here. Because we're in MSG, we get the hard camera ring entrances which I fucking love; it's a shame this only ever happened once again in 2008.
        </P>
        <p>
            D'Lo Brown and Grandmaster Sexay start. Definitely not related Lawler despairs over Sexay's number. Good hurricanrana and missile dropkick from Sexay. Headbanger Mosh has fake fuzzy breasts. Kai En Tai run in for the first time tonight and get thrown out. Christian enters the ring exactly as Mosh's breasts are thrown out of it, which I thought was pretty funny. Crowd is pretty dead at this point, probably reeling from the last match and the fact that it's obvious this is just a jobber section. Very over Rikishi comes in next and cleans house except for Sexay. Scotty 2 Hotty enters and the crowd flip out. Too Cool do their dancing schtick, which is rudely interrupted by Rikishi being a "rotten dance partner" and eliminating the other two, who take it in good humour. I fucking love this spot but sadly it's the only big spot in the rumble.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the camera has lingered on Big Kish's keister for an adequate length of time, very not over Steve Blackman enters and is promptly dispatched after another banzai drop. Scary looking Viscera enters next and delivers a good belly-to-belly suplex and weak looking chops and kicks. Really good looking superkicks from Rikishi and Vis is out. Rikishi has now eliminated six people in a row, they were really trying to push him hard here. So weird to see Big Boss Man in the ring in 2000, or should I say not in the ring as he waits out the 90 seconds to avoid facing Rikishi solo. I don't like it when wrestlers do this, JR says there's not a rule that wrestlers have to get in in the 90 seconds but there really should be (and yes I know it's dumb to complain about rules in a kayfabe match but come on).
        </p>
        <p>
            Over-with-the-ladies Test enters and gets a low blow from Boss Man. Rikishi avenges Test by giving a low blow to Boss Man which he sells fucking hilariously. So weird to see British Bulldog in the ring in 2000. JR and King talk about Rikishi's ass some more. Kind-of over Gangrel comes in. Another Kai En Tai run-in, and Taka genuinely smashes his collarbone on exit. Lawler keeps demanding the clip being replayed over the match even when it's known he's gone to the hospital. Edge enters. Match is not very interesting at this point due to a lot of midcard entrants and no eliminations.
        </p>
        <p>
            So weird to see Bob Backlund in the ring in 2000, also holy fuck he gets a fair pop. Everyone teams up to eliminate Rikishi. Chris Jericho enters and eliminates Backlund who decided to exit through the stands for some reason. Crash Holly enters and Edge spanks him while trying to eliminate him. Chyna next, who eliminates Jericho and is subsequently eliminated herself by Boss Man. Faarooq comes in, is attacked by the Mean Street Posse and eliminated by Boss Man again. When I first watched this I swore BBM eliminated like five people but it's actually just these two. Road Dogg enters and the crowd sings his theme song. Lawler keeps asking for The Rock on every entrant's countdown which gets pretty annoying imo. Dogg eliminates Bulldog. Al Snow and Val Venis enter. Funaki does a solo run-in. I love Road Dogg's strategy of clinging onto the bottom rope in the fetal position, perhaps the smartest strategy ever used in the rumble. Hairy Albert comes in and Edge goes out. Road Dogg argues with a ref about his strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crowd finally pops big as The Rock (aka the only guy in the match so far who has a chance of winning) comes in and dispatches Boss Man, and later Crash Holly. Former King of the Ring Billy Gunn comes in and goes for Rocky. Big Show comes in and eliminates Test and Gangrel which both have to be shown in replays because neither main camera was focused on them. Bradshaw comes in and is eliminated by the New Age Outlaws after Posse interference. Kane's pyro either doesn't go off properly or wasn't prepared and he just enters the Rumble like anyone else, and eliminates Venis. Godfather comes out and one of his hoes almost trips walking round the ring. Funaki solo run-in and King asks for a Taka replay again. King says "do they have Chinese hospitals in New York?" which is edited out of the YouTube version for being racist and stupid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Final entrant in X-Pac who has to wait for the hoes to leave before he can enter. Godfather (who must hate Rumbles because he's always out quick) and Snow are eliminated. Billy Gunn betrays Road Dogg and eliminates him, and is then eliminated by Kane. Rock throws out X-Pac who takes a really good looking bump outside, but the refs don't see and he comes back in. He manages to eliminate Kane but Show has none of it and military slams him outside. Rock and Show fight and Show drops him outside, except not really as Rock manages to hold on and wins the match.
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, this is just a pretty solid Rumble. New fans will probably enjoy it a fair bit, as I did when I first watched it. For more seasoned fans, this is pretty predictable and there were much better matches from the same decade such as 2001 and 2004 which would probably be better viewing, especially if you're into more segmented Rumbles like I am. The winner was obvious and the finish was pretty disappointing, although that's probably cause I've been worn out seeing giants eliminate themselves over and over again in recent years. At least Big Show managed to squeeze a Wrestlemania main event out of it.

            Very decent match between these two as usual, they had great chemistry together and both were excellent at selling each other's offense. Match is unfortunately quite short and Jericho loses after taking the weakest looking title belt shot ever. It's a shame X-Pac's gimmick was so overplayed at this point, he could go in these fast-paced matches.

        <h1>WrestleMania 2000 Hardcore Title 15 Minute Battle Royal</h1> 
    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>WWF WrestleMania 2000: A McMahon in Every Corner</h2>
        <h3>WWF Hardcore Title 15 Minute Time Limit Battle Royal</h3>
        <h3>2/4/2000</h3>

        <p>
            First off, this isn't a battle royal. It's a championship scramble. The only similarity it has to a battle royal is the number of participants, but in all other aspects it's a different match. Whoever pins or submits the current champion becomes the new champion, and the champion at the end of the 15 minutes is the reigning hardcore champion.
        </p>
        <p>
            The participants all come out and Tazz gets by far the biggest pop, followed by the APA and Crash who are all quite over. The match starts and instantly a logical problem arises that continues for the whole match. Crash Holly is the current hardcore champ, so surely everyone should go for him to try and get it, right? No, it seems, as everyone just mindlessly brawls with whoever is nearest them. Tazz, the only smart person in the ring, goes for Crash and wins the title within 30 seconds. Viscera picks Tazz up and gives him a weak looking shove into the ringpost, then the arena floor, and somehow manages to get a 3-count. Great job making Tazz look like a chump, I guarantee Vince made that decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            The match now devolves into incredibly boring hardcore comedy brawling, with few attempts to attack Viscera. This would have been acceptable on an episode of Raw or SmackDown, but for the biggest show of the year it's a joke. Crowd are quite into it though. Pete Gas has done a deep bladejob and his face is covered in blood, which is pretty pointless for a comedy match. The APA slam Viscera off the top rope and attack him with a 2x4, then inexplicably throw Kaientai over his body to cover him, leaving Funaki the hardcore champion. Why would they possibly do this? There's literally no benefit at all, it makes them look fucking moronic. Funaki runs to the backstage area and gets pinned by Rodney. Joey Abs pins Rodney and immediately gets hit by a rolling metal cabinet, which is probably the only actually funny spot in the match so far due to the timing. Thrash pins Joey and runs back to the arena, where he gets pinned by Pete Gas after a fire extinguisher to the face.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tazz wins the title back eventually and gets pinned a couple of times but kicks out. He reverses a pinfall by Mosh and the ref decides to count it, despite the fact that it would literally make no difference if it was a 3-count because Tazz is already the champ. This spot happens THREE TIMES in the match for some reason, and even the commentators give it shit the second time it occurs. It seems like everyone involved this match is holding the idiot ball. Hardcore Holly gives Tazz a beautiful dropkick when there's just under a minute left, and Tazz delivers a great belly-to-belly overhead suplex back.
        </p>
        <p>
            We then come to the famous botched finish of the match. Crash Holly manages to pin Tazz with 30 seconds left but Tazz locks in the Tazzmission. Hardcore Holly absolutely smashes Tazz in the face with a candy jar which reportedly really left shards of glass in Tazz's eye that had to be removed backstage, and pins Crash. The intention was for the timer to be under three seconds at this point, and for the time limit to run out while the pinfall was being counted, however due to a mistake in the timer in the referee's ear, Crash is very clearly pinned 1, 2, 3 with two seconds left on the clock, rightfully making Hardcore Holly the new champion. JR and King insist he got his shoulder up which he obviously didn't, and Fink is audibly confused on who the winner is before announcing Hardcore as the champ. Thankfully the Hollys shared entrance music and Crash simply won the belt back on the next night's episode of Raw.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall this match fucking sucks, basically. There's a reason the hardcore title shit was limited to about 5 minutes on PPVs, because it's not engaging enough to last longer than that. Bad ring action with a botched finish, no-one put over and a legit injury to a competitor, this is the part of the attitude era that it's good WWE left behind.

            This is the most pointless match in wrestling history. More pointless than any squash match. More pointless than any Great Khali or Giant Gonzalez or Eva Marie match. More pointless than any double DQ match. This is anti-wrestling. These stupid real or fake worked shoot matches do not work, because casual fans don't know what the commentators are referring to when they say stuff like "who's going over" and "calling on the fly", and more hardcore fans are gonna see through how full of shit Russo was when he booked this. This is AWFUL, and regardless of if Goldberg leaving halfway through was real or fake, it doesn't hide the fact that absolutely nobody cared.

            The Dudleys, masters of tables. The Hardys, masters of ladders. Edge and Christian, masters of chairs. Tables, ladders and chairs. An entirely new type of match-up, never seen before. And it's still a benchmark, even to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            The teams had torn the house down at WrestleMania the same year with their excellent three way ladder match, but even from there it seemed like there was untapped potential. The participants come out and every one of them is really over. Hardys try Poetry in Motion on Bubba and he blasts Jeff with a sick unprotected chairshot to the head. As with most E&C or Hardy matches, JR confuses the team members with each other and King corrects him after the fact. Matt breaks a ladder while trying to make an Edge sandwich. Pretty much every spot here is famous in one way or another, Jeff's huge swanton and Bubba's insane four table bump being the standouts. Holy fuck Lita almost got her head caved in by a ladder when Edge speared her, that was fucking scary. Love the spot where D'Von and Jeff fight in mid-air too, even though I think it was botched. All-time match, only overshadowed by its WM17 counterpart.

        <p>
            Russo strikes again. Horrendous stipulation, it's got nothing to do with a proper War Games match and it boils down to people mindlessly brawling with random weapons and with no spots besides Goldberg's admittedly good handcuff break section. Any wrestling not in the bottom ring is unwatchable because they can only film with an awful fixed camera angle. The announcers get confused about the rules while the match is taking place. There are two interferences by The Cat and Bret Hart which go nowhere. When Booker gets the title, they actively acknowledge that the fans will be confused over whether he's won or not, which should have been a very obvious sign that THE RULES ARE TOO COMPLICATED, SO CHANGE THEM. Then of course, a pointless swerve at the end that completely nullifies the whole match, just in case you were one of the very few people who still cared about WCW in 2000. A match that Vince Russo is involved in, participates in, and fucking wins cannot be any good.
