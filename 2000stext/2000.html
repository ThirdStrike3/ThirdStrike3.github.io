            Rikishi looks strong here, this was when they were considering him for WWF champion. He shouldn't have gotten it but he was pretty imposing in the ring at this point so I understand why they tried. Steph is on commentary and they keep cutting to a shot of her attempting to look distressed. Rikishi is AMAZING at selling clotheslines, he flips like a cruiserweight. Crowd is really into it and there's a huge pop when Rikishi kicks out of a chair shot. Great main event.

        <h1>Tazz vs. Kurt Angle</h1> 
    </header>

    <main>
        <h2>WWF Royal Rumble 2000</h2>
        <h3>Singles Match</h3>
        <h3>23/1/2000</h3>

            Angle delivers a good promo to begin the match. He references a "mystery opponent". The crowd here clearly didn't get the memo as they keep chanting "We want Tazz" over and over. His badass theme hits and Tazz makes his WWE debut, on a PPV no less. Champ Kurt does a moonsault sell of Tazz's German suplex, but due to Tazz's size it's a bit obvious Kurt's jump is doing most of the work. Tazz uses the Tazzmission to choke Kurt out and gets the win. Great way to set up Tazz as a beast (even if they fucking butchered his push) and gives Kurt an out for rematches with the dubious legality of the move.

        <p>Recommended for people who want to watch a short, explosive debut match.</p>
