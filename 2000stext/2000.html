            Rikishi looks strong here, this was when they were considering him for WWF champion. He shouldn't have gotten it but he was pretty imposing in the ring at this point so I understand why they tried. Steph is on commentary and they keep cutting to a shot of her attempting to look distressed. Rikishi is AMAZING at selling clotheslines, he flips like a cruiserweight. Crowd is really into it and there's a huge pop when Rikishi kicks out of a chair shot. Great main event.

            Angle delivers a good promo to begin the match. He references a "mystery opponent". The crowd here clearly didn't get the memo as they keep chanting "We want Tazz" over and over. His badass theme hits and Tazz makes his WWE debut, on a PPV no less. Champ Kurt does a moonsault sell of Tazz's German suplex, but due to Tazz's size it's a bit obvious Kurt's jump is doing most of the work. Tazz uses the Tazzmission to choke Kurt out and gets the win. Great way to set up Tazz as a beast (even if they fucking butchered his push) and gives Kurt an out for rematches with the dubious legality of the move.

            The whole build-up to this match is very good. I love how Triple H really sold the Cactus Jack transformation, it makes him seem like such a threat. The ramp is set up to look like an alleyway, making this feel like an actual "street fight". Satisfying sound as Jack hits Triple H's head into the ring bell. Lots of punching and they eventually brawl out into the crowd, then into the alleyway ramp. Hunter takes a good-looking suplex onto some wooden pallets. The crowd begins to chant "Boring" which King claims is them chanting "Foley". The match has been a little slow but I'm not sure why the crowd turned on it so quickly. Cactus attempts to knee HHH's head into the steel steps, where it looks like he rolls away at the last second but Cactus doesn't sell any pain so JR covers for them. For some reason the ref physically gets in Foley's way (which should not happen in a street fight, imo) when he tries to use the barbed wire 2x4, so HHH steals it and gives some hard shots to Jack's body. Great fake-out as the ref hides the 2x4, so Cactus demands it back and hits the Spanish announcer in the process. He gives TWO shots to Triple H's head, and his bladejob looks monstrous. Everything from this point on is perfect. Jack takes a really nasty-looking back body drop on the announce table where it doesn't break, and the crowd are actually chanting "Foley" now. Hunter hip-blocks Cactus into the steel steps and it looks like he really fucks up his knee. He does it again and it looks even more painful than the previous one. Triple H works Foley's knee while masterfully selling his own injuries, including a deep gash on his own leg. Cactus gets handcuffed and starts playing really dirty, with low blows and biting, like a caged animal. Triple H gives some vile chair shots and actually breaks a steel chair on Cactus's back. They frame the alleyway really well and Rock comes flying out of nowhere with a fast but safe chair shot to Triple H. Absolutely disgusting piledriver to HHH on the Spanish announce table, probably the most dangerous move of the match. Foley gets thumbtacks out. Huge pop. Triple H back body drops him onto the tacks and Pedigrees him. 1... 2... FOLEY KICKS OUT!!!!!!!!!! Crowd go fucking apeshit. First time I saw this I legitimately popped out of my seat it was that unexpected. Triple H delivers another Pedigree directly on the thumbtacks and the ref has to slam his hand into them to count to three. Triple H sold perfectly and Foley worked the crowd expertly. One of the most physical. intense, scary, and above all BRUTAL matches ever in the WWF. Easy, easy five here.

            Perhaps because of the clusterfuck of the 1999 Rumble match, we get a lot more reserved and normal match here. Because we're in MSG, we get the hard camera ring entrances which I fucking love; it's a shame this only ever happened once again in 2008.
        </P>
        <p>
            D'Lo Brown and Grandmaster Sexay start. Definitely not related Lawler despairs over Sexay's number. Good hurricanrana and missile dropkick from Sexay. Headbanger Mosh has fake fuzzy breasts. Kai En Tai run in for the first time tonight and get thrown out. Christian enters the ring exactly as Mosh's breasts are thrown out of it, which I thought was pretty funny. Crowd is pretty dead at this point, probably reeling from the last match and the fact that it's obvious this is just a jobber section. Very over Rikishi comes in next and cleans house except for Sexay. Scotty 2 Hotty enters and the crowd flip out. Too Cool do their dancing schtick, which is rudely interrupted by Rikishi being a "rotten dance partner" and eliminating the other two, who take it in good humour. I fucking love this spot but sadly it's the only big spot in the rumble.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the camera has lingered on Big Kish's keister for an adequate length of time, very not over Steve Blackman enters and is promptly dispatched after another banzai drop. Scary looking Viscera enters next and delivers a good belly-to-belly suplex and weak looking chops and kicks. Really good looking superkicks from Rikishi and Vis is out. Rikishi has now eliminated six people in a row, they were really trying to push him hard here. So weird to see Big Boss Man in the ring in 2000, or should I say not in the ring as he waits out the 90 seconds to avoid facing Rikishi solo. I don't like it when wrestlers do this, JR says there's not a rule that wrestlers have to get in in the 90 seconds but there really should be (and yes I know it's dumb to complain about rules in a kayfabe match but come on).
        </p>
        <p>
            Over-with-the-ladies Test enters and gets a low blow from Boss Man. Rikishi avenges Test by giving a low blow to Boss Man which he sells fucking hilariously. So weird to see British Bulldog in the ring in 2000. JR and King talk about Rikishi's ass some more. Kind-of over Gangrel comes in. Another Kai En Tai run-in, and Taka genuinely smashes his collarbone on exit. Lawler keeps demanding the clip being replayed over the match even when it's known he's gone to the hospital. Edge enters. Match is not very interesting at this point due to a lot of midcard entrants and no eliminations.
        </p>
        <p>
            So weird to see Bob Backlund in the ring in 2000, also holy fuck he gets a fair pop. Everyone teams up to eliminate Rikishi. Chris Jericho enters and eliminates Backlund who decided to exit through the stands for some reason. Crash Holly enters and Edge spanks him while trying to eliminate him. Chyna next, who eliminates Jericho and is subsequently eliminated herself by Boss Man. Faarooq comes in, is attacked by the Mean Street Posse and eliminated by Boss Man again. When I first watched this I swore BBM eliminated like five people but it's actually just these two. Road Dogg enters and the crowd sings his theme song. Lawler keeps asking for The Rock on every entrant's countdown which gets pretty annoying imo. Dogg eliminates Bulldog. Al Snow and Val Venis enter. Funaki does a solo run-in. I love Road Dogg's strategy of clinging onto the bottom rope in the fetal position, perhaps the smartest strategy ever used in the rumble. Hairy Albert comes in and Edge goes out. Road Dogg argues with a ref about his strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            The crowd finally pops big as The Rock (aka the only guy in the match so far who has a chance of winning) comes in and dispatches Boss Man, and later Crash Holly. Former King of the Ring Billy Gunn comes in and goes for Rocky. Big Show comes in and eliminates Test and Gangrel which both have to be shown in replays because neither main camera was focused on them. Bradshaw comes in and is eliminated by the New Age Outlaws after Posse interference. Kane's pyro either doesn't go off properly or wasn't prepared and he just enters the Rumble like anyone else, and eliminates Venis. Godfather comes out and one of his hoes almost trips walking round the ring. Funaki solo run-in and King asks for a Taka replay again. King says "do they have Chinese hospitals in New York?" which is edited out of the YouTube version for being racist and stupid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Final entrant in X-Pac who has to wait for the hoes to leave before he can enter. Godfather (who must hate Rumbles because he's always out quick) and Snow are eliminated. Billy Gunn betrays Road Dogg and eliminates him, and is then eliminated by Kane. Rock throws out X-Pac who takes a really good looking bump outside, but the refs don't see and he comes back in. He manages to eliminate Kane but Show has none of it and military slams him outside. Rock and Show fight and Show drops him outside, except not really as Rock manages to hold on and wins the match.
        </p>

            All in all, this is just a pretty solid Rumble. New fans will probably enjoy it a fair bit, as I did when I first watched it. For more seasoned fans, this is pretty predictable and there were much better matches from the same decade such as 2001 and 2004 which would probably be better viewing, especially if you're into more segmented Rumbles like I am. The winner was obvious and the finish was pretty disappointing, although that's probably cause I've been worn out seeing giants eliminate themselves over and over again in recent years. At least Big Show managed to squeeze a Wrestlemania main event out of it.
