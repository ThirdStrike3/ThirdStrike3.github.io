            Imaging paying to see this Raw in MSG and your main event is an 11 and a half minute squash match with a non-wrestler. BOOOORIIING. Jim's bladejob looks monstrous, I felt so bad for him here. At least the crowd pops when Batista gets there. Also, let it be known that JR has a pinfall victory over Reign of Terror Trips. That's awesome.

            Pairing the always incredible Shawn Michaels with the absurdly underrated Shelton Benjamin was always gonna be amazing, but this match even exceeded those expectations to become one of the greatest WWE matches ever. Both men just look so athletic and impressive all throughout, from the mat wrestling beginning to the high-flying ending stretch. Everything Michaels does, Benjamin one-ups and I love how you can see Shawn slowly respecting his opponent more and more as the match progresses. The double kip-up is amazing. The pinfall reverses are insane. Shelton's enziguiri is godly. <i>The ending Sweet Chin Music might be my favourite spot ever.</i>

        <p>Of all the singles matches i've reviewed this might be the one with the most universal appeal, so recommended to everyone.</p>
