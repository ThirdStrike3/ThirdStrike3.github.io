            Imaging paying to see this Raw in MSG and your main event is an 11 and a half minute squash match with a non-wrestler. BOOOORIIING. Jim's bladejob looks monstrous, I felt so bad for him here. At least the crowd pops when Batista gets there. Also, let it be known that JR has a pinfall victory over Reign of Terror Trips. That's awesome.

            Pairing the always incredible Shawn Michaels with the absurdly underrated Shelton Benjamin was always gonna be amazing, but this match even exceeded those expectations to become one of the greatest WWE matches ever. Both men just look so athletic and impressive all throughout, from the mat wrestling beginning to the high-flying ending stretch. Everything Michaels does, Benjamin one-ups and I love how you can see Shawn slowly respecting his opponent more and more as the match progresses. The double kip-up is amazing. The pinfall reverses are insane. Shelton's enziguiri is godly. <i>The ending Sweet Chin Music might be my favourite spot ever.</i>

        <p>Of all the singles matches I've reviewed this might be the one with the most universal appeal, so recommended to everyone.</p>

            I wish they didn't cut to the Raw and SmackDown wrestlers as much as they do, we really don't need like 15 shots of JBL mocking the match, but what a fucking match it is. Suicide dive almost instantly. Tanaka being table dropped on his fucking head. Sick fucking vile chairshots to both men. DDT through a table. OUT OF NOWHERE suicide dive by Awesome. They had less than ten minutes and decided to just go and go and go. If all of WWECW was like this it would have been the best thing ever.

        <h3>Singles Match</h3>
        <h3>27/11/2005</h3>

        <p>
            This match is best summed up by Long's first action being to pose on the turnbuckles and getting one solitary "Boo!" in reponse. NOBODY wanted this. The fact this was on an actual PPV is proof that Vince despises his fans. I usually watch matches at least twice to rate them but I honestly could not bring myself to sit through this again, and it's only 5 minutes.
