            The CM Punk storyline was an oasis in the generally very poor landscape of WWE circa 2011. When shit like Lawler vs. Cole and endless terrible women's and comedy matches were being pushed, we had one of the freshest and most engaging storylines in years getting the main event at this PPV. Quite possibly the most invested crowd of all time were at this event, they boo and cheer at literally every mention or show of either competitor. The intro video is very dramatic but at the time it makes a lot of sense, though for some reason they do a lot of stuttering cuts that make Punk sound like Bubba Ray.

            Punk comes out, crowd are nuclear already. Not one of the commentators is fully behind Punk, which I don't hugely like (imo there should always be a heel and face sympathiser on a commentary team), although it does add to the "one man fighting the system" role. A guy in the front row is holding an "If Cena wins, we riot" sign, like the RVD match from 6 years earlier. Match starts and the familiar "You can't wrestle" and "Cena sucks" chants fly. Punk hilariously plays off the chants to further get the crowd on his side. Lots of sleepers and slow offense to build the match, which works really well with these ravenous crowds. "Colt Cabana" chants, which is funny in hindsight. Punk's crossbody looks kind of weak, but the suplex to the outside by Cena is quite good. Booker references Rocky IV, which is also funny in hindsight given Punk's recent comments. Unique front facing AA from Cena but only gets a two. Match is flying by despite the moves not being that impressive because both performers are brilliant at working the crowd. Punk botches a backflip off Cena's attempted suplex and almost lands on his head. Very scary-looking. Love how Punk takes his time to high-five members of the crowd randomly, more wrestlers should do that when in their hometown. Five-Knuckle Shuffle from Cena that barely connects, followed by a great Attitude Adjustment where Punk botches another landing. Cole is cheering for Cena to win, what? Aren't you the heel announcer? Punk gives a great knee shot to Cena's chin that looked like it really hurt. Awesome finisher countering sequence which the crowd is really invested in, but neither can finish each other off. Punk "counters" a top rope attack from Cena by just shoving his hands in front of him. More finishers, and kickouts.

            Orange Vince and Laurinitis come out to attempt to screw Punk out of the title, just like Montreal, but Cena fucks Laurinitis up with a shot to the face. Awesome moment. In my opinion they should have had the fight go on for another five minutes from here, Punk wins almost immediately after which makes it look cheap. Vince tries to get Del Rio to cash in his briefcase but Punk gets him good with a kick to the head. Punk leaves through the crowd and Vince only sells his anger a few seconds after the cameras are turned on him. Punk makes it out the arena and the cameras finish on a shot of a dejected McMahon.

            Despite this review being negative in places I really do love this match, the crowd are super invested and both performers are excellent at creating heat. While there are a few too many botches and things that irritate me about it to give it a perfect score, it's BY FAR the best WWE storyline of 2011 and one of the best WWE stories in general, capped off by an incredible, feel-good hometown victory for Punk.

            Christian has taken a page out of Vince's book and is covered in orange tan. His look is awful here, I wish he kept the long hair for longer, he reminds me of Test when he shaved his head. That aside, he could really go in ring and was in my opinion the better of the E&C pairing. Good punch-kick section to start the match off, but an ungrateful crowd is already chanting for tables.

            Randy clears the announce table but doesn't clear the monitors, which makes it obvious that the attempted spot on them won't happen. Christian heelishly runs into the crowd with the title but Randy gets him back into the ring. Randy goes fucking nuts with corner punches but fails a charge and does a great ringpost shoulder bump. Both men are expertly selling, and it's why this match works really well as a whole. Christian gets out a kendo stick and holds it phallically on the top rope. Orton reverses it into a wicked dropkick and looks really scary and intimidating with the blood on his lips. There's a great variety of wrestling moves in this match, it never feels like they're retreading old ground at any point which can be a problem for the wrestling sections of NHB matchups.

            Nice crowd pop for Orton sliding one table, then two out from under the ring. Crowd idiotically still chant "we want tables" afterwards. Excellent superplex onto the table. One of the legs breaks, and Orton smartly adapts by resting the table against a ringpost, which I love. Christian reverses and teases a Spear, which Randy does an epic leapfrog over and attempts an RKO which also gets countered. Brilliant sell by Christian as his knees go hurtling into the steel steps. Christian reverses and literally has to drag Randy to the Spanish announce table. Amazing RKO counter into an RKO and both men go absolutely crashing through the table. Looked incredibly good. God the selling is so brilliant. Insane Killswitch but only gets a 2. Crowd are unbelievably hyped. Attempted solo con-chair-to but Randy reverses and goes fucking nuts, smashing the chair over Christian and knocking him through the table set up ages ago.

            The ending sequence involves two trash cans, the steel steps, the one-legged table and a kendo stick, which are all used on Christian. The RKO on the steel steps is goddamn insane and I love how Christian gets one kendo stick shot back in just before the end, a brilliant fake-out moment. The whole bit makes Orton look badass and Christian look uber-strong. Genius match, great callbacks to their previous outings, and a perfect cap to their excellent feud.
