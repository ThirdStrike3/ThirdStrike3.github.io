            Redemption after their stinker of a match at Wrestlemania XX. Short and to the point, like matches between two monsters should be. Goldberg's entrance here is pretty lame compared to his old ones though. The match literally goes like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            German > German > German > Spear > Spear > Spear into the barricade > Spear > Jackhammer > failed Spear (insane leapfrog by Brock) > German > German > German > German > German > German > German > F5
        </p>
        <p>
            and it works perfectly for what they were trying to accomplish. Both men take some insane punishment in a short amount of time and both look very strong. Maybe I'm just biased because I love German suplexes though.
        </p>
