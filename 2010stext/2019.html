            Hard to talk much about this match I suppose, it's just a really really good match between two of the best female wrestlers of all time. The punches and kicks throughout look so vicious, especially Asuka's mean kicks to the face near the start and that lethal back roundhouse kick nearer the end. The suplex from the apron to the ring floor looked awesome. Asuka getting a clean submission win was a great decision and established her as a true force to be reckoned with.

            Remember - Asuka was the SmackDown Women's Champion less than TWO WEEKS before Wrestlemania 35, and now she's wrestling on the fucking pre-show. That is abysmal. At least she gets her own entrance (that she is hilariously late for), along with Naomi. Nikki Cross does her boring "crazy" schtick, and is out quickly. Naomi is also out relatively quickly for some reason. It seems like they're giving the NXT women some love as Asuka and Ember Moon are getting most of the eliminations so far, but then Ember gets eliminated by fucking Lana of all people. Sarah Logan goes to eliminate Kairi Sane after she goes to the top rope. Kairi hangs on but Sarah seems to forget that you can still attack people when they're hanging on and idiotically walks away without doing anything else. Kairi hits her typically incredible elbow drop but is soon eliminated for real by the Riott Squad. Dana Brooke is somehow the most over person in the match and eliminates Liv Morgan and Ruby Riott. Terrible looking spot as Sonya Deville attempts to pull the top rope down to eliminate Brooke but since she doesn't weigh a lot it barely moves, so Dana has to do a super hurdle to get into position on the apron.

            Pool clears until the "final three" - Asuka, Sonya Deville and Sarah Logan. It looks so obviously like an Asuka win at this point. Asuka eliminates Sonya and then is instantly thrown out by Logan. What a waste. Carmella - who was never eliminated - comes out from under the ring and fights with Logan for a bit until she throws her out, winning the match. Literally the exact same finish as the previous year's Wrestlemania women's battle royal. Impressively lazy. Shit battle royal and made most people involved look like jokes.

            Very house show styled match but quite enjoyable for what it is. Everyone does well here but the Kabuki Warriors do the best. Alexa Bliss is also great. I do not understand when a member of one team tags into a member of another team, isn't that just making it more likely that somebody else will win? Unfortunately, no memorable spots here.
