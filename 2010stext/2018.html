            The <s>Fabulous Moolah</s> first ever women's Wrestlemania battle royal! Or at least, that's what Lilian Garcia says. She must have forgotten about the classic Mania 25 match. And I will say, for the first ever proper women's battle royal at Wrestlemania... it's fucking horrible!
        </p>
        <p>
            Becky, Sasha and Bayley are the only women who get proper entrances, all three being legit contenders to win. Spoiler alert: none of them do, yet still get higher positions on next year's Mania card than the actual winner. Match starts and both Carmella and Dana Brooke are ganged up on and thrown out by everyone else, after a horrifically cringe outburst of "that's not nice!" to Natalya.

            Battle lines are drawn quick and the NXT women fight the rest of the Raw and SmackDown rosters. After some posing in the middle Becky starts an argument with Kavita Davi, saying "orange is my colour!". Who the fuck wrote these dialogue spots? Awful. Cole mentions that Davi was trained by The Great Khali, which isn't a good thing and it shows. Bianca Belair spends way too long on the top turnbuckle and looks really nervous, but does a great 450 splash when it comes time. WWE shows how much they care about the first ever women's battle royal by cutting to an advertisement for action figures, missing Kairi Sane's elimination.

            The main roster women eliminate the rest of NXT, except for Becky Lynch who's pushed out by Mickie James of all people. Peyton Royce takes a particularly dangerous looking head scissors bump out. Nattie is eliminated by Banks and Bayley and her pants split open when she hits the ground. Banks and Bayley team up to eliminate The Riott Squad. Sarah Logan has to vault the top rope to get to the outside cause Sasha has no weight to pull it down properly. Bayley and Sasha shake hands, and Bayley betrays her by throwing her out. Bayley celebrates being the only one in the ring, which is quickly dashed when Naomi comes back in the ring and hits her with the Rear View to throw her over and get the win.

            This match really sucked. The eliminations mostly looked bad, NXT were treated like jokes with no members even coming close to winning, Becky got zero shine at all and the starting section was just terrible. Bianca Belair was probably the only person who actually got to show some genuine in-ring skills here. And what was Naomi's reward for winning this match? Wrestling in it again at Mania 35. What a joke.

            Very good technical match with absolutely the wrong pick for winner. You have Asuka who has Goldberg-level white-hot momentum with her insane undefeated streak and Rumble win and then we get Charlottewinslol with a Figure Eight that didn't even have much leg work beforehand so the submission just comes out of nowhere. Very strange but since Shinsuke also lost it seems like it was just a shit year for Rumble winners. At least we get some really great moments in the match, like Asuka turning a moonsault into the Asuka lock and that dangerous looking suplex to the floor.

            Brock is at his best when he's working with smaller guys, and this match is no exception. First time I watched this match I seriously thought it might just be a squash match and nothing more, because they really stretch out the complete domination of Brock with those vile German and belly-to-belly suplexes that Bryan sells like he's dead. You can hear smatterings of the crowd chanting "Boring" at points, understandable considering Bryan's first offensive move is about 10 minutes into the match. Just as it looks completely hopeless, the match kicks into the highest octane gear with that ref bump and that BRUTAL looking low blow to Brock followed by that SUPER BRUTAL running knee. Brock is an absolute master at selling and he shows it. It's exhausting just watching this match. Unfortunately, the F5 finish is pretty anticlimatic, but this match is so brutally good I don't care.
