            Excellent promo video before the match. Brock is a scary fucking guy, it's just that he can't really do in-ring promos off-the-cuff too well. In these backstage interview settings he's a fucking intimidating beast. He's got so much momentum from his return and he's over with the crowd (although to be fair, this crowd would have cheered anyone over Cena), so surely he's going to win. Right?

            The match starts and Cena's head is busted open within about 20 seconds. Both men just go for takedowns and punches, with Brock coming out on top with some nasty elbow strikes to the head. Looks AWESOME. Charles Robinson is way too into the match and keeps trying to separate both men, which would make sense on a normal PPV but this is literally called "Extreme Rules". He takes a ref bump to the outside for his troubles. Cena gets small amounts of offense in but this is shaping up to be a brutal squash match. Brock goes to wrap Cena's padlock chain around his fist to use as a weapon, but changes his mind and uses it to chain his legs together and suspend him upside down from a ring post. Hilarious spot where Brock picks up the ref by his belt with one hand and throws him back in the ring.

            ANOTHER ref bump after Brock gives Cena an F-5, so Brock can't get a winning pin. Far far too excessive with the ref bumps here, it's like WCW level. Brock pushes the ring steps into the center of the ring and stands on top of them to pose. He looks so awesome, especially compared to Cena who gives the weakest you can't see me ever right after. Brock does a really painful looking Kimura lock on Cena's arm who sells it like a motherfucker. Lesnar does an incredibly impressive running vault off the steps over the top rope to attack John.

            Then we get to the reason this match isn't more highly regarded than it is - the ending. Brock goes for the same jump off the steps but Cena clarts him in the head with the padlock chain around his fist. Just ONE Attitude Adjustment on the steps later, and Cena's won the match. Terrible fucking decision, and the epitome of Supercenawinslol. After all the punishment Brock gave out, and all of it Cena took, he gets one stretch of offense in and wins. Killed the fuck out of Brock's return momentum. At least he got his revenge with the very deserved squash match at SummerSlam 2014. Great match overall, but fuck that ending was the wrong call.

        <p>Recommended to see how fiery Brock's return could have been.</p>
