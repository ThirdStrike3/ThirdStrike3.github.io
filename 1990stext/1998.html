            The match that represents everything that the Attitude Era did right, story-wise. Funny how most of Rock's famous matches are when he was working a heel. Don't get me wrong, the brawling is still really good but that ending, man. Stone Cold received the literal biggest reaction from any crowd in pro wrestling history. This was the match that proved the WWF were destined to overtake WCW, and it's perhaps the best underdog story in wrestling.
