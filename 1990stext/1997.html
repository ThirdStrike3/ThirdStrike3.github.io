        <h3>No Holds Barred Submission Match</h3>
        <h3>23/3/1997</h3>

            Austin's entrance is perfect. The fight to the outside is swift and ferocious. The crowd brawling is super entertaining and chaotic. Bret's offense looks very realistic and his targeting of Austin's knee is done really well. Austin's selling is so good. The figure four leglock through the ring post looks absolutely brutal, no doubt that would tear up your legs for real. The commentary team and crowd are both super invested in the match, JR is unbelievably good as usual but I think Jerry gives maybe his best performance ever here as a shithead heel and as a guy with a vendetta against Hart. Austin had to pretend to be busted open accidentally as blading was disallowed in the WWF in 1997 so takes a really nasty looking throw into the announce area barricade to do it. Blood really spurts from his head, I was shocked when I first saw it. Bret is turning into more and more of a heel as the match goes on. Austin looks like the most badass person to ever walk on Earth. So many classic calls are being made by every commentator. Crowd goes insane for one of the best Sharpshooters in history. Austin is screaming and blood is still pouring from his forehead. He tries to break the Sharpshooter and all three commentators are in shock. Bret barely clings on and Austin has no energy left to try again, and passes out in a pool of his own blood, but never gave up. Shamrock has to stop the fight. Bret tries to put Austin in the Sharpshooter again and gets booed. Austin established his lone badass character just by walking to the back on one leg. The greatest heel turn ever and the greatest face turn ever.

            A masterpiece of wrestling. The greatest WrestleMania match of all time, bar none.
