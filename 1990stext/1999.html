            Called a Rumble match, but really only is in spirit as there are two "teams", the Corporation and DX, making this more of a Survivor Series type match. Shane comes out with Ken Shamrock and joins commentary, which I actually think is pretty well done. He's really trying to be like his father, even emulating his voice, and plays a cocky rich boy heel decently well, even if some of his outbursts are really cringeworthy. Lawler and Cole are also fairly good here. Shamrock eliminating himself is just dumb. Why does Test enter to the New Age Outlaws' music, was it a genuine fuckup? If so they breeze past it pretty well. The ending is really good, with a double surprise as VKM comes out to "win" the Rumble, and Chyna comes out to spoil his fun. Insane pop for Stone Cold too, as there was during the Mankind-Rock match just a bit ago. Vince fucking twats his head on the bottom rope on elimination, looked really nasty. Nice fun match overall.

            Not much to say about the wrestling itself really, it's pretty standard and what you'd expect from a match between these two performers - that being very solid workrate with some impressive moves scattered within. X-Pac's backflip off Gangrel followed by a sweet side suplex is probably the highlight. Gangrel needs to sell a bit more though, it's especially notable compared to X-Pac's awesome selling. This match is however notable for one hilarious, amazing thing. Pac jumps on Gangrel from a corner turnbuckle, which Gangrel reverses into a pin. His shoulders are very clearly down for all 3 of referee Teddy Long's counts, but instead of end the match (which would give the wrong winner), or do anything at all to pretend it was a 2-count, Teddy just decides to continue the match with no decision. The fans immediately shit on it, chanting "you fucked up" and holding three fingers up. This would be amazing by itself, but a bit later on in the match you can see Teddy seemingly listening to what was presumably Vince screaming in his earpiece, which chad Teddy decides to just remove and put away. Fucking amazing. Gains an extra .25 for that alone.
