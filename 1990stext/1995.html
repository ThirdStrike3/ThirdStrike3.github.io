            The combined weight of both the men in this ring is 1209 pounds. And that was presented as a good thing.

            Match is about what you'd expect from two men as horizontally challenged as Yoko and Mabel. Long staredowns, lockups, punches. Stalling for time on the outside. Yokozuna is gassed really quickly into the match. Mabel goes for an awful standing bulldog which visibly does not make contact with Yoko. King exclaims "he missed it!" and Yoko sells it anyway. Mo, Fuji and Cornette fight on the outside and Yoko falls on a downed Cornette, who does a hilarious flailing sell like something out of a cartoon. Sadly, it's the most enjoyable part of the match so far. Both men get counted out which angers the crowd. They then have the world's fattest staredown in the ring to no crowd reaction, and then reveal their alliance by hugging each other, rendering the entire match pointless. Well, more pointless than it already was.
