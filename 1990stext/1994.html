        <h3>VTOP Woman Tournament First Round Match</h3>
        <h3>20/11/1994</h3>

        <p>
            Tokyo Dome entrances are always cool, and this match is no exception. Manami soaks in all the babyface glory and we get to hear Aja's awesome theme song as she strolls towards the ring, menacingly. Only problem is that the crowd is pretty dead at this point considering we're 16 (!!!!!!) matches into this 23-match show. What a shame that one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time is in such a slump period.

            Match starts off ferociously hot as Manami gets in some super-fast, high flying offense with a couple near falls, but Aja manages to catch her in mid-air and delivers a great gutwrench suplex. Aja keeps on grounding Manami and puts her in a Boston crab and a painful-looking camel clutch. I love how Manami screams and tries to bridge out of all of Aja's cover attempts - super face heat every time. Manami reverses an Irish whip into a lovely top rope reverse crossbody but gets a kick to the chest when she tries to hit a top rope nothing-move from the corner. Aja hits a really dangerous piledriver and Manami barely manages to kick out, selling it like a boss.

            Both women get bits of offense on the other but Aja eventually comes out on top and hits a top-rope superplex followed by another Boston crab which looks more devastating than the first one. After some more moves, she takes Manami out to the ring ramp and delivers an absolutely amazing thunder fire powerbomb with a flip on the ramp surface. Looks absolutely incredible but is clearly quite safe on replay. Aja then follows up with a variation on the Great Muta/Hogan 1993 ramp-running spot, but instead of a clothesline she delivers a shoulder tackle. TWO more sit-out piledrivers but Manami manages to barely force her way out of the pins and the crowd start really rallying behind her.

            Aja hits a bodyslam and goes to the top rope but Manami counters with an insane high kick which spills Aja to the outside of the ring. She then follows up with an almost botched top rope splash followed by a perfect, perfect missile dropkick from the corner turnbuckle. Everything about that spot is incredible. Unfortunately afterwards it's followed by a splash from the corner onto Aja through a table which, while good, is pretty contrived as Aja literally has to climb onto the table and lie on it motionless. Crowd is very hot at this point and given how tired the crowd should be, it just shows how amazing this match is. A bodyslam and a moonsault can't put the monstrous Aja away, and even an excellent tiger suplex into a pin only gets a 2.

            Aja is working off pure desperation here and hits Manami with a bunch of different suplexes and bombs but she won't stay down. Manami hits an absolutely amazing Victory Star Drop from the top rope that looks like it could have legitimately killed Aja if she took it even slightly wrong. One of the most famous spots in women's wrestling and one of the most dangerous, this might be the best move of the entire match, Weirdly, Manami seems to cheat despite being a face and puts her foot on the bottom rope during the following pin attempt, but I assume it was accidental. Aja manages to counter a moonsault by kicking Manami in the chest in another crazy spot. Manami is taken to the top rope but manages to whack Aja in the back with a great missile dropkick, and she lies motionless in the middle of the ring. 1... 2... AJA KICKS OUT!!! Even the ref is stunned. So fucking good. Manami doesn't give up, though, and keeps fighting but Aja has a counter for everything she throws at her. Eventually, she gets Manami with a brutal falcon arrow for a final 3-count. Both women are exhausted, but the towering Aja manages to make her way out of the ring by herself, and Manami is carried out by officials.
            <b>
            In conclusion, what the fuck. How can a match have so many classic moments, have such an insane workrate, and be just a 17 minute FIRST ROUND match in a tournament? How is that even possible? Manami Toyota is such a good babyface here you could show this to someone who'd never seen a wrestling match before and they would be on their feet rooting for her to win at the end. And Aja is somehow even better, taking and delivering some of the hardest hitting bumps of all time to show how unstoppable she was in her prime. An absolute masterpiece and exactly what wrestling is about.
