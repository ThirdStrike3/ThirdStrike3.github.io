            Very good technical match, but ruined by one major flaw. Regal gets his head busted open early by accident and due to WCW's policy of not showing blood on TV, they have to do a wide-angle camera view which makes it difficult to see the big moves, although it is interesting having more of a "crowd" view than usual. Benoit hits a good tombstone piledriver during it.
